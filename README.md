# Flashcard-App-Capstone

# Overview

## Overview
A React Project that reaches into backend JSON API server to retrieve information on decks and cards. You can create, read, update and delete decks and cards. This project is designed to test our ability to work with rendering and state management using React. 

## Challenge
A full-stack application designed to test on us the front-end attributes of software engineering. Thinkful has already provided us with the prebuilt backend components. We must also be able to do the following with ease:

*Installing packages via NPM
*Running tests from the command line
*Writing React function components
*Creating routes, including nested routes, using React Router
*Using hooks like useState(), useParams(), and useHistory()
*Debugging React code through console output and using the VS Code debugger

## What I've learned 
This gave me a realistic insight on how to work with an existing database and what a full stack application built with React looks like. This was more challenging than I expected because I had to make sure to create files with Links and nested Routes.
